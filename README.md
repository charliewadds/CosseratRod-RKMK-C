## Introduction

This repository contains the C implementation of the SuRFR: A fast recursive simulator for soft manipulators with discrete joints on SE(3) paper. The original project was developed in MATLAB as part of a paper by Hossain Samei and Robin Chhabra. This implementation aims to enhance the runtime efficiency and performance an allow for faster than real time execution.
